This sample was obtained by scanning the same bamboo cut on both sides and composing the crops in a single image.
It is meant to test tube detection and contour detection.

The scan was performed at 400 DPI in PNG format, and later converted to JPEG at 90% quality.

A matte black box was placed on top of the tube in the scanner bed to obtain the black background.
